As you probably know, WriteRoom (http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) is a very minimalistic text editor, focusing on a clean appearance of just the edited document. This script creates &#039padding&#039 around the editing window in gVim and hides the vertical splits and other items to obtain this same effect, while keeping all of Vim&#039s extensive features available. 

Using the file is simple, just issue a gvim -S ~/.vim/writeroom/writeroom.vim {filename} at the command line to open the file in a very clean, minimalist setup. Perfect for ADD-ers like myself ;-)

This file adds the following:

Commands:
=========

WriteRoomBG {color} ; sets the background color
WriteRoomFG {color} ; sets the foreground color
WriteRoomFilename {color} ; sets the color for the filename just below the editing window
WriteRoomNonText {color} ; sets the color for non-text characters

Functions:
==========

UpdateScreen() ; updates the screen size and colors

Mappings:
=========

<F5> toggles visibility of EOL, TAB and tilde lines
